## Project Overview

This project aims to support a comprehensive literature review and practical study in the field of signals and systems, with the following main objectives:

- **Survey advanced spectral analysis techniques** such as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), bispectrum, trispectrum and time frequency analisys as applied to fault detection in rotordynamics.
- **Review machine learning methods** for signal classification, especially for distinguishing fault conditions.
- **Compare methodologies and results** with state-of-the-art approaches reported in the literature.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Simulated and real datasets referenced in the literature and used in experiments.
- `results/`: Outputs of analysis, figures, and comparative tables.
- `docs/`: Literature review notes, summaries, and bibliographic references.

## Technologies Used

- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- Scientific libraries: NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib

- Summarize key concepts: time and frequency domain analysis, linear and nonlinear system behavior.

### 2. Spectral Analysis Techniques
- Study the theory and application of FFT, bispectrum, trispectrum, and related higher-order spectral methods.
- Compare the strengths, limitations, and implementation details of each method.
- Document findings from influential publications and textbooks.

### 3. Feature Extraction and Fault Diagnosis
- Survey approaches for extracting features from spectral analysis, with emphasis on fault detection in rotordynamic systems.
- Review case studies and experiments from the literature.
- Summarize common signal characteristics associated with different fault types.

### 4. Machine Learning for Signal Classification
- Explore supervised and unsupervised learning techniques for classifying faults using extracted features.
- Compare algorithms such as SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks, and others.
- Analyze validation methods, metrics, and benchmarking strategies as presented in the literature.

### 5. Comparative Analysis
- Synthesize methodologies and results from reviewed papers and reports.
- Identify trends, gaps, and opportunities for improvement in the field.
- Prepare comparative tables and visualizations to summarize literature findings.

### 6. Practical Implementation and Experimentation
- Translate literature insights into practical experiments using simulation and real data.
- Validate and compare results with those reported in the literature.

### 7. Documentation and Reporting
- Maintain detailed notes and summaries of reviewed articles and books.
- Update repository with annotated bibliographies, summaries, and code experiments.

### 8. Resources & Recommended Readings
- List foundational textbooks, review articles, and open datasets relevant to the field.
- Example resources:
  - "Signals and Systems" by Oppenheim & Willsky
  - "The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing" by Steven W. Smith
  - Key journal articles and conference proceedings
