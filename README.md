## Project Overview

This project aims to support a comprehensive literature review and practical study in the field of signals and systems, with the following main objectives:

- **Survey advanced spectral analysis techniques** such as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), bispectrum, trispectrum and time frequency analisys as applied to fault detection in rotordynamics.
- **Review machine learning methods** for signal classification, especially for distinguishing fault conditions.
- **Compare methodologies and results** with state-of-the-art approaches reported in the literature.

## Repository Structure
